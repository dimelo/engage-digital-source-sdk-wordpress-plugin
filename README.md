# Engage Digital Source SDK WordPress plugin

To integrate you will need to follow these steps:

1. Install the plugin. There are 2 options:
  - upload the `smcc_sdk` folder in `wp-content/plugins`
  - go to `Plugins > Add new`. Click on `Upload`, choose the zip archive (see below) and click on `Install Now`.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Configure the plugin (go to `Settings` > `SMCC SDK`) and set a secret key.

To create a valid zip archive of the plugin:

1. Go to the repository's `Tags` page.
2. Download the most recent zip you find there.
3. Unzip the archive.
4. Make another archive of only the `smcc_sdk` folder (right click on the folder and click compress).
5. Follow the installation steps as listed above.

Note: *The option `Comment author must fill out name and e-mail` must be enabled for the plugin to work correctly.*
